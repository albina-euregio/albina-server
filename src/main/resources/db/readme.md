# Liquibase for Automatic Database Migrations

## 1. Apply Appropriate Hibernate Annotations

## 2. Automatically Generate Changelog
Use `liquibase diff` to suggest a changelog file.
The changelog generated by diffChangeLog/generateChangeLog should be inspected for correctness and completeness before being deployed. Some database objects and their dependencies cannot be represented automatically, and they may need to be manually updated before being deployed.

```bash
 mvn liquibase:diff -Dliquibase.diffChangeLogFile=test.xml -Dliquibase.diffIncludeObjects="table:regions"
```

## 3. Manually Check and Adapt Changelog

## 4. Validate Correctness

`liquibase validate`

## 5. Commit Java Changes and Liquibase Changelog together

## 6. Deploy with `ALBINA_DB_RUN_MIGRATION=true`

SQL script naming convention
-----

```
<folder number>_<sequence number>_<description>.sql
```

The Idea behind:

The numbers define the execution order, so that all scripts could be copied to
a directory and successfully executed in the corresponding alphabetical order

Automatic DB migration at application start
----

To perform the DB migration automatically at server start, the environment variable ALBINA_DB_RUN_MIGRATION must be set to true.

```
ALBINA_DB_RUN_MIGRATION=true
```

Manual DB migration with liquibase (docker image)
-----

When executing liquibase manually, the Changelog must be in the db directory.
Otherwise, there will be problems if you switch between manual execution and
automatic execution when starting the server, as the file ID will
no longer match.

```
docker run \
  --rm \
  -e INSTALL_MYSQL=true \
  -v <RESOURCE_DIR>:/liquibase/changelog \
  liquibase/liquibase \
  --url="jdbc:mysql://<DB_HOST>:<DB_PORT>/<DATABASE NAME>" \
  --changeLogFile=db/changelog-main.xml \
  --username=<DB USER> \
  --password=<DB_PASSWORD> \
  update
```
