These can in many cases be released by small loads. The avalanche prone locations for dry avalanches are to be found adjacent to ridgelines in all aspects and in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. These places are clearly recognisable to the trained eye. Additionally avalanches can be released in the old snowpack and reach large size in isolated cases, this applies in particular in case of a large load. In particular transitions from a shallow to a deep snowpack are unfavourable. Individual gliding avalanches are possible. Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger.",
