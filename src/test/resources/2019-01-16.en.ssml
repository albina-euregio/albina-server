<p><s>Many starting zones have released the snow but not entirely. In the regions exposed to heavier precipitation and on steep east, south and west facing slopes more large and, in isolated cases, very large avalanches are to be expected as a consequence of warming during the day. On steep grassy slopes individual medium-sized and, in isolated cases, large gliding avalanches are possible below approximately 2400 m. The conditions are very dangerous for winter sport activities outside marked and open pistes. This also applies in areas close to the tree line and below the tree line. Precautionary closures of transportation routes may be necessary. Closures must be respected and safety instructions of the authorities must be followed.</s></p>
<break time="1s" strength="strong"></break>
<p><s>And now the snowpack:</s></p>
<p>Weak layers in the upper part of the snowpack represent the main danger. The wind slabs have bonded insufficiently with each other and the old snowpack. The fresh snow and wind slabs of last week are lying on the unfavourable surface of an old snowpack in all aspects. Dunes on the snow surface and whumpfing sounds and the formation of shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack can indicate the danger. Remotely triggered avalanches are possible.</p>
