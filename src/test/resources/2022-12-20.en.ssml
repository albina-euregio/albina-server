<p><s>Weak layers in the old snowpack can be released in some places by individual winter sport participants. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in particular on steep west, north and east facing slopes above approximately 2000 m. Caution is to be exercised in particular adjacent to ridgelines, as well as in gullies and bowls, and behind abrupt changes in the terrain. Whumpfing sounds and the formation of shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack indicate the danger. Avalanches can reach medium size. <break time="1s"/> The mostly small wind slabs of the last few days are in individual cases still prone to triggering, especially on shady slopes at high altitudes and in high Alpine regions, as well as adjacent to ridgelines. <break time="1s"/> Meticulous route selection is recommended. <break time="1s"/> As a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation gliding avalanches and moist snow slides are possible, in particular on sunny slopes, as well as on cut and grassy slopes especially at intermediate altitudes.</s></p>
<break time="1s" strength="strong"></break>
<p><s>And now the snowpack:</s></p>
<p>Towards its base, the snowpack is faceted and weak, especially on steep west, north and east facing slopes above approximately 2000 m, as well as on steep sunny slopes in high Alpine regions. Released avalanches and field observations confirm the unfavourable bonding of the snowpack. <break time="1s"/> In some cases the wind slabs have bonded still only poorly together. As a consequence of mild temperatures the snow drift accumulations will stabilise on Tuesday. <break time="1s"/> Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise to gradual softening of the snowpack in some cases on sunny slopes in particular at intermediate altitudes.</p>
We have the following danger patterns: dp.1: deep persistent weak layer, dp.2: gliding snow.
