Single winter sport participants can release avalanches as before, including dangerously large ones, in particular, along the border with Italy. Dry avalanches can additionally be released in the old snowpack by a single winter sport participant, in particular in areas where the snow cover is rather shallow between approximately 2200 and 2700 m and on very steep slopes. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in all aspects. Caution is to be exercised in areas with glide cracks. This applies in particular on steep grassy slopes below approximately 2400 m. In the afternoon as a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation there will be only a slight increase in the danger of moist and wet avalanches. Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger.",
