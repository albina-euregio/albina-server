<p><s>Weak layers in the upper part of the snowpack can be released in some places by individual winter sport participants.

In some cases the avalanches are large. <break time="1s"/> <break time="1s"/> The fresh wind slabs can still be released in some cases in particular on very steep shady slopes above approximately 2400 m.

<p>High altitudes and the high Alpine regions: <break time="1s"/> The northwesterly wind has transported a lot of snow. Faceted weak layers exist in the top section of the snowpack, in particular on very steep sunny slopes above approximately 2600 m. Field observations and released avalanches indicate the existence of a weak snowack. Towards its base, the snowpack is largely stable. <break time="1s"/> Low and intermediate altitudes: <break time="1s"/> The old snowpack is wet and its surface has a melt-freeze crust that is strong in many cases. The high temperatures as the day progresses will give rise to slight moistening of the snowpack. This applies on very steep sunny slopes.</p>
We have the following danger patterns: dp.4: cold following warm / warm following cold, dp.2: gliding snow.
