<p><s>The sometimes large wind slabs of the last three days represent the main danger, especially above approximately 2200 m. Single winter sport participants can release avalanches as before, including dangerously large ones, in particular, along the border with Italy. Dry avalanches can additionally be released in the old snowpack by a single winter sport participant, in particular in areas where the snow cover is rather shallow between approximately 2200 and 2700 m and on very steep slopes. The avalanche prone locations are to be found in all aspects. Caution is to be exercised in areas with glide cracks. This applies in particular on steep grassy slopes below approximately 2400 m. In the afternoon as a consequence of warming during the day and solar radiation there will be only a slight increase in the danger of moist and wet avalanches. Backcountry touring and other off-piste activities call for experience in the assessment of avalanche danger.</s></p>
<break time="1s" strength="strong"></break>
<p><s>And now the snowpack:</s></p>
<p>The fresh snow and wind slabs of the last few days are lying on soft layers above approximately 2200 m. Avalanche prone weak layers exist in the centre of the snowpack, in particular between approximately 2200 and 2700 m. The somewhat older wind slabs are bonding only slowly with the old snowpack in all aspects above approximately 2200 m. The surface of the snowpack will soften during the day. This applies on steep sunny slopes in particular at low and intermediate altitudes in these regions.</p>
We have the following danger patterns: dp.6: cold, loose snow and wind, dp.5: snowfall after a long period of cold.

<p><s>As a consequence of fresh snow and a strong wind from northerly directions, wind slabs formed in particular adjacent to ridgelines and in gullies and bowls. In particular on wind-loaded slopes avalanches can be released easily and reach a dangerous size. Especially in regions with a lot of snow and in high Alpine regions avalanche prone locations are more prevalent and the danger is greater. The avalanche prone locations are clearly recognisable to the trained eye. Apart from the danger of being buried, restraint should be exercised as well in view of the danger of avalanches sweeping people along and giving rise to falls.</s></p>

<p>The snowpack will be subject to considerable local variations. In many cases fresh snow and wind slabs are lying on the soft surface of an old snowpack. Whumpfing sounds and the formation of shooting cracks when stepping on the snowpack are a clear indication of a weakly bonded snowpack.</p>
