This applies adjacent to ridgelines and in pass areas. <br/> Sunshine and high temperatures will give rise to gradual softening of the snowpack at low and intermediate altitudes. This applies on sunny slopes, and in the regions exposed to the foehn wind. <br/> Only a small amount of snow is lying for the time of year."
